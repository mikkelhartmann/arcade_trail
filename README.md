# Arcade Trail
This is work in progress.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is try out a couple of machine learning algorithms on data from video games. This includes video game reccomendations and genre classification. 

## Installing requirements and running the jupyter notebook
The program is written in python 3. I suggest you run this in a virtual python enviromnent.

### Setting up the virtual environment
To create the virtual environment do:
virtualenv --no-site-packages -p <path/to/python3> env/

Start to virtual environment:
source env/bin/activate

Install the requirements:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

When you are done working, remember to deactivate the virutal environment:

### Running the Jupyter Notebook locally
Once the virtual environment in set up, the Jupyter notebook can be run by doing:
jupyter notebook classifying_genres_from_description.ipynb


## Example of output code
